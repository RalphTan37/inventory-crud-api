# Inventory Management System - CRUD API Project
I am developing a CRUD API for an inventory management system using Golang. </br>
The purpose of this personal project to deepen my understanding of web development and database iteraction. </br>
CRUD, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete forms the foundation of applications that manage data. </br>

**Running the Application:**
To run the application, type ```go run main.go ``` into the terminal. Open another terminal and type ```curl localhost:3000```. 
The output should result: "Inventory System Project".  It'll mean the server is properly working. In the first terminal, to terminate the server, press Crtl + C.
